# 🔒 THE BIG PICTURE (LOCKED)

## What You Are Building

> **A Curated Thinking-and-Execution System where ideas are never destroyed, only promoted into shared reality, and AI preserves continuity.**

This is **not**:

* a chat app
* a document editor
* a task manager
* a whiteboard clone

It is a **decision engine**.

---

## The Fundamental Principle (Do Not Break This)

**Thinking is private by default. Reality is curated. Memory is permanent.**

Everything flows from this.

---

# 🧱 SYSTEM MODEL (FINAL)

The system has **exactly 5 core surfaces**.
No more. No less.

---

## 1️⃣ SHARED BOARD (Canonical Reality)

**Purpose:**
Represents *what the group currently agrees matters*.

**Properties**

* One per project / topic
* Visually a whiteboard
* Only curated content exists here

**Contains**

* Idea cards (curated)
* Decision cards
* Task widget (kanban)
* Meeting summaries
* Constraints / assumptions

**Permissions**

* Community Manager (or role):

  * Promote ideas
  * Edit phrasing
  * Merge duplicates
  * Archive outdated items
* Others:

  * View
  * Comment (optional)

**Important Rule**
Nothing enters automatically.
Everything is *pulled* from personal spaces.

---

## 2️⃣ PERSONAL SCRIBBLEPAD (Private Thinking)

**Purpose:**
Safe space for raw cognition.

**Properties**

* Private by default
* Unlimited
* Freeform (text, bullets, sketches later)

**Can Contain**

* Brain dumps
* Meeting notes
* Draft ideas
* Calculations
* Half-baked thoughts

**Actions**

* Select content → “Submit to Board”
* Share whole pad or partial blocks
* Convert scribble → idea → task

**Non-negotiable**
❌ Nothing here can be deleted by others
❌ Rejection does not erase thinking

This is **psychological safety encoded as software**.

---

## 3️⃣ TASK SYSTEM (Execution Spine)

**Purpose:**
Turn decisions into motion.

**Single Source of Truth**
Each task exists **once**, but is visible in:

* Shared Board (kanban widget)
* Personal task list
* Personal calendar

**Task Properties**

* Owner
* Deadline
* Priority
* Status
* Origin (idea / meeting / manager)

**Rules**

* Assigning a task auto-adds to personal calendar
* Status changes sync everywhere
* Tasks always trace back to *why they exist*

---

## 4️⃣ COMMUNICATION (Contextual, Not Floating)

### 💬 Chats

* 1:1 or small group
* Always linked to:

  * A task
  * A board item
  * A meeting

No global chat.
No noise.

---

### 🎥 Meetings

* Audio/video
* Meetings are **inputs**, not containers

After every meeting:
AI auto-generates:

* Summary
* Decisions
* Action items
* Open questions

Auto-distributed to:

* Shared board
* Task system
* Personal spaces

Missed meeting = no information loss.

---

## 5️⃣ AI LAYER (Silent Operator)

**AI Never**

* Owns ideas
* Makes final decisions
* Acts without consent (v1)

**AI Always**

* Observes
* Summarizes
* Connects
* Suggests

---

### What AI Does Globally

* Summarize boards
* Detect duplicate ideas
* Flag contradictions
* Fetch sources
* Cross-verify claims
* Maintain long-term memory

---

### What AI Does Personally (Opt-in)

* Daily task planning
* Deadline risk warnings
* Task breakdowns
* Embedded tools:

  * Calculator
  * Data fetcher (RAG / web)
  * Graph generator
  * Analyzer

AI = **execution amplifier**, not manager.

---

# 🔁 THE LOOP (THE CORE VALUE)

This loop must always remain intact:

```
Private Thinking
      ↓
Curated Reality
      ↓
Tasks & Execution
      ↓
Meetings & Work
      ↓
AI Memory
      ↓
Back to Shared Understanding
```

If any feature breaks this loop, it does not ship.

---

# 🚫 EXPLICIT NON-GOALS (V1)

Lock these out now.

* ❌ Social feeds
* ❌ Likes / upvotes
* ❌ Public profiles
* ❌ AI autonomy
* ❌ Marketplace / plugins
* ❌ External integrations beyond calendar
* ❌ Real-time multiplayer whiteboard complexity

Restraint is the product.

---

# 🧪 V1 SCOPE (LOCKED)

### ✅ V1 MUST HAVE

1. One shared board
2. Personal scribblepads
3. Manual idea submission → manager approval
4. Task widget with calendar sync
5. Meeting summary → tasks extraction
6. AI summarization + similarity detection
7. **Video Calling with Transient Board**
   *   Pre-decided or emergency meets.
   *   Live shared whiteboard (notes, lines, shapes).
   *   **On End:** Board content auto-saved to every participant's Personal Scribblepad.

### ❌ V1 DOES NOT HAVE

* Work-hour tracking
* Advanced analytics
* Multi-board linking
* Public sharing

---

# 🧠 V1 USER ROLES

### 👤 Participant

* Think privately
* Submit ideas
* Execute tasks
* Use AI planner

### 🧑‍⚖️ Community Manager

* Curate shared board
* Assign tasks
* Lock decisions
* Resolve conflicts

No other roles in v1.

---

# 🏷️ PRODUCT IDENTITY (FINAL)

This is not “collaboration software”.

It is:

> **A system that prevents organizations from losing thought.**

Your strongest selling line:

> *“Nothing intelligent ever disappears again.”*

---

[UI]

Got it. No layout. No components. No wireframes.
Just **the feeling**, written explicitly and deliberately.

---

## What the Product Should Feel Like

### Entering It

It should feel like **walking into a quiet room where something important is already in progress**.

Not busy.
Not welcoming in a loud way.
Calm, focused, intentional.

You don’t feel invited to scroll.
You feel invited to **look**.

---

### The Whiteboard

The whiteboard should feel like **the only thing that matters**.

Not a canvas.
Not a surface.
A **shared mental object**.

It feels:

* Finite
* Heavy
* Deliberate
* Earned

Nothing appears on it casually.
When something is on the board, it feels *validated*, not posted.

You should instinctively understand:

> “If it’s here, it survived scrutiny.”

The whiteboard is not infinite because truth isn’t infinite.
It holds only what the group currently stands behind.

---

### Space Around It

The darkness around the board should feel like **silence**, not emptiness.

It creates pressure in a good way.
It says:

> “Don’t rush. Think before you add.”

The contrast should make the board feel protected, almost ceremonial.

---

### Interacting With the Board

Interacting with the whiteboard should feel **slightly weighty**.

Nothing is instant.
Nothing pops.
Nothing gamifies.

When something moves, it feels like repositioning an idea in your own head.

When something is added, it feels like **placing**, not dropping.

When something is removed, it feels like **retiring**, not deleting.

---

### Private vs Shared

Your private space should feel **safe, messy, and invisible**.

You should feel free to be:

* Wrong
* Repetitive
* Uncertain
* Incoherent

Sharing from it should feel like:

> “I’m ready to put this under light.”

Not like posting.
Not like submitting.
Like **offering**.

Rejection should feel neutral, not personal.
Because nothing was lost.

---

### Authority and Power

Authority should feel **quiet and editorial**, never performative.

The person curating the board does not feel like a boss.
They feel like a librarian, an editor, a maintainer of coherence.

Decisions feel recorded, not declared.

---

### AI Presence

AI should feel like **a background intelligence**, not an entity.

It doesn’t speak unless helpful.
It doesn’t interrupt.
It doesn’t feel clever.

When it acts, it feels like:

> “Of course someone noticed this.”

Not:

> “Wow, AI did a thing.”

You trust it the way you trust a spellchecker or a good assistant.

---

### Time

Time should feel **compressed but preserved**.

You should never feel:

* Left behind
* Out of the loop
* Punished for absence

Returning after time away should feel like:

> “Here is what matters now.”

Not:

> “Catch up on 300 things.”

---

### Emotion

The dominant emotion should be **calm seriousness**.

Not excitement.
Not hustle.
Not fun.

But also not cold.

It should feel like:

* A research room
* A strategy war room
* A studio where thinking matters

People should behave better here, without being told to.

---

### The Core Feeling (This Is the Line to Test Against)

If you strip everything else away, the product should feel like:

> **A shared whiteboard where only the group’s best current thinking is allowed to exist, and nothing intelligent is ever lost.**

If a future feature weakens that feeling, it does not belong.

That’s the north star.
